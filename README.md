This repository is for learning how to make the original joycon2cpp usable on Mac. 
Since most of the code is incompatible with Windows and Linux
I have changed the repository as follows to avoid affecting the original project.
Nothing has been committed here.


# joycon2cpp

A C++ executable that makes Switch 2 controllers into working PC controllers.

---

## DISCLAIMER

This project is **Windows-only**, primarily because the `ViGEmBus Driver` (used for virtual controller output) is exclusive to Windows.  
You're free to make your own macOS/Linux fork if you want.

I don't actually own a Pro Controller 2 or an NSO GC Controller, so their decoders might suck. Sorry! However, if you DO own these controllers, you can help out by:
- Testing the program's decoders and see if both controllers work fine
- Edit the code to make them better based on your own testing (if you do this, make a fork out of it and submit a pull request! I'd be glad to accept it, any kind of cool stuff that gets added i'll be a big fan of.)

For some people, theres been reports of delay when using the program. Me personally, while my JoyCon 2 sticks report 50-60ms in a polling rate tester, their feel and delay is.. fine. If you think you have a solution to this, feel free to make a pull request of it. All I wanna say is it's something related to either your PC or your controller.

## PROGRESS
- Multiplayer (Complete, Working)
- Single Joycons (Complete, needs slight Sideways mapping changes)
- Dual Joycons (Complete, Working)
- Pro Controller (Complete, Working)
- NSO GC Controller (In-Progress, prototype has been added)
- Gyro Support (Yes)
- Mouse Support (Yeah, but the speed needs to be increased)

## DEPENDENCIES

- [ViGEmBus drivers](https://github.com/ViGEm/ViGEmBus/releases/latest)

---

## How do I use it?
- Download the exe in the source code and open it, or optionally build the source code and open the created exe file
- Pick your amount of players
- Pick everyone's controller
- If using a singular joycon you'll be asked if its Left or Right
- If using dual joycons itll ask you to pair one joycon then the other
- When its all done, you'll have SDL controllers ready for every player to use.

> üí° Note: Bit layouts differ slightly between left and right Joy-Cons, so correct side pairing is important.

## Building from source

If you want to build the project yourself, follow these instructions (Windows + Visual Studio):

üì¶ Requirements  

Make sure the following are installed via Visual Studio Installer:

‚úÖ Visual Studio 2022 or newer (you'll probably be developing in this anyway)

‚úÖ Workload: Desktop development with C++

‚úÖ Component: Windows 10 or 11 SDK

‚úÖ Component: MSVC v14.x

‚úÖ (Optional but useful) C++/WinRT  



1. Open a command prompt or PowerShell in the project root folder.

2. Create and enter a build directory:

   ```sh
   mkdir build
   cd build

3. Generate Visual Studio project files with CMake:
    ```sh
    cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64
4. Build the project in Release mode:
    ```sh
    cmake --build . --config Release
5. The compiled executable will be located in:
    ```sh
    build\Release\testapp.exe

# Joy-Con 2 BLE Notification Research

This document outlines some findings related to Joy-Con 2 BLE input behavior. If you're developing or reverse-engineering Joy-Con 2, Pro Controller 2, or other supported Nintendo controllers over BLE, this may be useful.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Behavior Quirks

A notable quirk of these controllers is that if you attempt to connect or pair them repeatedly in a short time span, they may stop responding or fail to connect entirely for several minutes. This appears to be a controller-level cooldown behavior rather than an OS/BLE stack issue.

**If your controller stops connecting:**  
Wait a few minutes before trying again. It should recover on its own.

## üîî BLE Notification (with IMU enabled, Left Joy-Con)

Here‚Äôs an example notification received from a Joy-Con 2 via BLE, with the IMU command sent. (Pro Controller 2 and GC Controller notifications follow similar layouts but may shift certain fields.)

08670000000000e0ff0ffff77f23287a0000000000000000000000000000005f0e007907000000000001ce7b52010500beffb501ee0ffeff04000200000000


### Field Breakdown (based on known Joy-Con 2 layout)

### üìò Notes

- Left Joy-Con **does not use Right Stick**, so data at `0x0B‚Äì0x0D` is typically junk.
- **Stick values** use 12-bit X/Y packed across 3 bytes:
  - X = upper 12 bits of first 1.5 bytes
  - Y = lower 12 bits of next 1.5 bytes
- **Accel/Gyro** fields are signed 16-bit:
  - Accelerometer: `4096 = 1G`
  - Gyroscope: `48000 = 360¬∞/s`
- **Temperature**:  
  `25¬∞C + (raw / 127)`  
  ‚Üí `25 + (3679 / 127) ‚âà 54¬∞C`
- **Battery voltage**:  
  Reported as millivolts. `3000` = 3.0V. If `0x0000`, likely unavailable at that time.
